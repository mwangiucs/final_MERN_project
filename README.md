## 🧪 Testing

The application includes mock AI responses when OpenAI API key is not provided, so you can test all features without external API dependencies.

## 🎨 Customization

### Themes
Toggle between light and dark mode using the theme toggle in the navbar. Theme preference is saved in localStorage.

### Styling
The app uses CSS variables for theming. Customize colors in `client/src/index.css`:
```css
:root {
  --bg-primary: #ffffff;
  --accent: #4f46e5;
  /* ... */
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Connection Issues
- Ensure MongoDB is running locally or use a valid MongoDB Atlas connection string
- Check your `MONGO_URI` in the `.env` file

### CORS Issues
- Ensure the backend CORS middleware is configured correctly
- Check that the frontend proxy is set up in `vite.config.js`

### File Upload Issues
- Ensure the `server/uploads` directory exists
- Check file size limits in `server/middleware/upload.js`

## 📝 Notes

- The application uses mock AI responses when OpenAI API key is not provided
- All passwords are hashed using bcryptjs before storage
- JWT tokens expire after 30 days
- File uploads are limited to 50MB by default

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

- Real-time notifications using WebSockets
- Video streaming integration
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Social features (discussions, comments)
- Mobile app development
- Integration with more AI models
